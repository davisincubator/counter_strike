# Analysis Notes

1. Check out relationship between skill group and outcome in round 1 for de_inferno.
  - Perhaps this explains the bias towards T winning in round 1 for higher skills.
  - Provide an interactive plot that shows this relationship for each map.

2. Would like to look at (round_start_time - bomb_plant_time) for T wins; hypothesis being that higher skill groups get bomb down faster to flip team roles (ex: CTs now aggressors) and win by eliminating CTs; also site distribution for bomb plants (ex: more bomb plants at A site for de_dust2?)
3. Jason: flash and smoke data? Kyle: economics in general; regression analysis predicting wins based on purchases (ex: teams that buy more flashes/smokes win more than those that do not; teams that buy scouts a lot also lose a lot)
4. Nick: data-driven "perfect" first round by map? 
5. can we build a little script to track our progress over time? access through console? does this already exist? if we build it we can also potentially save other users data
